# Create Design

## Starting point

The parameter is a path to a research document (produced by `/research-codebase`). Read it fully before doing anything else.

## Steps

### 1. Read the research file

Read the specified file completely (no offsets or limits). Extract:
- The problem being solved
- Current state of the codebase (files, patterns, constraints)
- Any open questions flagged by the researcher

Also read any files the research document references with `file:line` notation that are critical to understanding the problem.

### 2. Identify design axes

Based on the research, identify the key decisions that must be made before implementation can begin. For each axis present 2–3 concrete options, e.g.:

```
**Design Options:**

1. [Option A] — [what it does, trade-offs]
2. [Option B] — [what it does, trade-offs]
3. [Option C if applicable]

Which approach fits best?
```

Only ask about decisions that genuinely affect the implementation path. Do not present options that are equivalent in effort or outcome.

### 3. Iterate with the user

- Present one set of options at a time; wait for the user to choose before moving on.
- If the user's answer reveals a misunderstanding, spawn a **codebase-analyzer** or **codebase-locator** sub-agent to verify the facts, then re-present.
- Keep iterating until every major design axis is resolved.

### 4. Summarize and confirm

Once all decisions are made, show a concise summary:

```
**Agreed Design:**
- [Decision 1]: [chosen approach]
- [Decision 2]: [chosen approach]
- [Out of scope]: [explicit exclusions]

Does this capture the design correctly?
```

Wait for user confirmation before saving.

### 5. Save the design

Saving is a two-step process to avoid shell-quoting bugs with large markdown content:

**Step 1** — get the target path by running:

```
python create_thought.py claude-code-design <file_name_description> [ticket]
```

Where `<file_name_description>` is a short kebab-case topic label, and `[ticket]` is optional. The script prints the absolute path to stdout (and creates the parent directory). It does NOT write the file.

**Step 2** — use the `Write` tool directly to write the content (formatted per the template below) to that printed path.

Tell the user where it was saved.

## Output file format

```markdown
# Design: [Topic]

## Problem Statement
[One paragraph: what we are solving and why]

## Research Source
[Path to the research document this was derived from]

## Design Decisions

### [Axis 1]
**Choice:** [chosen option]
**Rationale:** [why this was chosen over alternatives]

### [Axis 2]
**Choice:** [chosen option]
**Rationale:** [why]

## Out of Scope
[Explicit list of things we are NOT doing]

## Open Questions
[Anything that still needs clarification before structure can be built]
```

## Notes

- Do not write a plan or list implementation steps — that is for `/create_structure`.
- Stay skeptical: if a design choice seems to contradict what the research found, say so.
- All decisions must be resolved before saving. Do not save a design with unresolved questions.
